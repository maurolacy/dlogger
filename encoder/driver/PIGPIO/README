INSTALL

Extract the archive to a directory.

IN THAT DIRECTORY

Enter the following two commands (in this order)

make
make install

This will install:
   the library (libpigpio.a) in /usr/local/lib
   the header file (pigpio.h) in /usr/local/include
   the daemon (pigpiod) in /usr/local/bin
   the socket interface (pigs) in /usr/local/bin
   the utility pig2vcd in /usr/local/bin
   the Python module pigpio.py

TEST

To test the library do

sudo ./checklib

checklib.c, demolib.c, pig2vcd.c, pigpiod.c, pigs.c, and pigpio.py
show examples of interfacing with the library.

DAEMON

To launch the daemon do

sudo pigpiod (pigpiod -? for options)

Once the daemon is launched the socket and fifo interfaces will be
available.

When the library starts it locks

/var/run/pigpio.pid

The file should be deleted when the library terminates.

SOCKET INTERFACE

Use pigs for the socket interface (pigs help for help).

FIFO INTERFACE

The fifo interface accepts commands written to /dev/pigpio.

Results are read from /dev/pigout.

Errors are output on /dev/pigerr.

To test the fifo interface perhaps do

cat /dev/pigout &
cat /dev/pigerr &

echo "help" >/dev/pigpio

PYTHON MODULE

By default the Python pigpio module is installed to the
default python location.  You can install it for additional
Python versions by

pythonx.y setup.py install

where x.y is the Python version.

If the pigpiod daemon is running you can test the Python
module by entering the following commands.

python

import pigpio

pigpio.start()

print(pigpio.get_current_tick())

print(hex(pigpio.read_bank_1()))

pigpio.stop()

help(pigpio)

quit()

STOP DAEMON

To stop the pigpiod daemon

sudo killall pigpiod
